Each gentoo developer may make new ebuilds for  both main gentoo tree and for each overlay.
<br />
So, he should have several github projects - one for the fork of gentoo tree, one for forks of each overlay. 
<br />
<br />
Layman should know which overlays belong to this developer.
<br />
Configuring layman for personal overlays will allow to test ebuilds when they are not yet accepted to the corresponding upstreams
<br />
So somewhere should be the file  on github with the metainformation about overlays (list of personal overlays)
<br />
<br />
Also developer probably will write notes about his steps. I think it is possible to combine personal site with the list of personal overlays.

<h2>"overlays:" section of /etc/layman/layman.cfg</h2>
Add some line similar to this one:
<br />
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArsenShnurkov/shnurise/master/github-gentoo-dotnet-metadata-for-layman.xml

<br />
<br />
To change repository name locally without modification of .gitignore file:
<br />
git update-index --assume-unchanged profiles/repo_name
<br />
This labels the file "profiles/repo_name" as unchanged, even if it differs from the content of online repossitory
