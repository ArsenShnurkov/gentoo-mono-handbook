<br />
Since May 30, 2014 repository size limits are:
<br />
Soft limit of 1 GB – In-product and email notifications will give you a heads-up that you’re approaching the limit.
<br />
Hard limit of 2 GB – Pushing to the repository will be disabled until you’re back under the limit.
<br />
If you already have a repository that is larger than the 2GB limit, your repository has been grandfathered so you won’t have any issues.
<br />
only about .01% of repos are over the 2GB limit and are mostly from individual users for non-code projects such as storing MP3s or movies.
<br />
GIT will normally start suffering performance problems and that’s by Git design
<br />
So can have 20 repos with 1GB? Or is there also a limit on the account level?
<br />
Bitbucket does not have any limits on the amount of size a user consumes in their account, but a single repository should not go over 2GB
